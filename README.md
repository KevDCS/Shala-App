Shala-App Landing page exercise


This is a tutorial I found on Youtube that creates a Landing Page using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap.

The link for the video is this, in case you wanna try it for yourself.

The site doesn't have much sections, but it does have a lot of elements so the code is a lot, at least for me that I'm learning, it was a lot.

Everything works fine, the site is responsive, you can change the site from light to dark mode, but it has this issue with a horizontal scroll that I was not able to fix.

Thanks for stopping by.
